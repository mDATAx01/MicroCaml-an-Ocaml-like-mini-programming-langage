# MicroCaml and Microtop: an Ocaml like and Ocaml-based mini programming langage

This project involves the implementation of MicroCaml, a variant of OCaml with a
reduced feature set and dynamic typing. Unlike OCaml, MicroCaml lacks compile-time
type checking, similar to scripting languages like Python and Ruby, where type validation
occurs during runtime. 

Additionally, the project includes the development of mutop
(Microtop), a version of utop tailored for MicroCaml
